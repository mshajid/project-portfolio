### Instructions

Before you dive into the code, better to have the VS code extension called "Better Comments" by **Aaron Bond**. Follow these instructions to see the color variants properly.

- First fork the repository. 
- Simply navigate to the index.html and keep the stylesheet which color variant you would like to have, and rest of them uncomment to avoid the conflict.
- Optional: Keep the "Better Comment" VS code extension to see the comment clearly with the highlight.
